  <h3>Distributed Team</h3>
  </header>
  <h5>We work primarily remotely except when needed onsite.</h5>
  <p>
    Do not assume that because a consultant is onsite giving you a lot of face-time that they are being productive and/or 
    effective for your needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure clients get the most out of our engineers most of our work is conducted in a distributed manner. 
    Working from our own offices with visits to client sites when necessary. Communication with our clients is important 
    which is why we employ the following methods to do so:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Onsite Meetings or Collaboration:</strong> some times we really do need to meet with our clients face-to-face.
      At the beginning and end of our engagements, shifting phases and/or for on-site deployments and client training. We 
      want to get to know our clients better and there are important, critical phases of contract engagements that we make 
      sure we can be onsite to better serve them. However, having a body onsite at the client becomes expensive financially 
      for the client and can become physically taxing on the consultant after a while, so we try to send consultants onsite 
      when necessary rather than keep one there "just in case".
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Telephone:</strong> we realize we are in the twenty first (21st) century now, but often a phone call is 
      the most appropriate mode of communicating. We aren't afraid to pick up our handset when we need to ask a 
      question or return a call.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Online Conferencing:</strong> this could be audio-only, video conferencing or screen sharing to demo our 
      work to a client audience remotely.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Instant Messaging or Chat:</strong> with our long-term and current clients we make sure we are available to our 
      clients on <abbr title="Instant Messaging">IM</abbr> or a Chat service. At times a client only needs to ask us something 
      very quickly that requires us to answer with code snippets or similar. Instant messenger or chat services are often the 
      most appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Remote pair programming/debugging:</strong> many of the contracts we work on for consulting clients require us 
      to work closely with client developers, system administrators, data center technicians, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Email:</strong> there is a reason we left this to last. Email is great, but we also want to avoid becoming slaves 
      to our inboxes. We find it more effective to consider other modes of communication first and use email when no other mode is 
      more suitable. That doesn't mean we don't email often. It just means we try to cut down on email noise as much as possible.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Having a large arsenal of communication modes works surprisingly well. Different phases of software design, development 
    and deployment require different modes of communication to be effective partners. This ensures our engineers aren't 
    physically and emotionally exhausted so that they can offer clients their best at all times while still working closely with clients.
